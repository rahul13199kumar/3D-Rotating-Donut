# Description

A 3D Rotating Donut ,To render a 3D object onto a 2D screen, we project each point (x,y,z) in 3D-space onto a plane located z’ units away from the viewer, so that the corresponding 2D position is (x’,y’). Since we’re looking from the side, we can only see the y and z axes, but the math works the same for the x axis (just pretend this is a top view instead). This projection is really easy to obtain: notice that the origin, the y-axis, and point (x,y,z) form a right triangle, and a similar right triangle is formed with (x’,y’,z’). Thus the relative proportions are maintained.
